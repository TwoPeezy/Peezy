*Scenes* are the main functionality behind this game.

A *Scene* has a few key components:

- **Scene name** -  Goes beside the title on the window like Peezy - 'Title name'
- **I.D.** - The hardcoded link that buttons refer to
- **Image** - Image that gives the scene presence
- **Description** - A gripping narrative that compells the player to tears
- **Button Options** - Different options to continue the adventure

The human friendly way to add a scene is to use the JSON exporter tool, **newscene.html**, and paste the result into *scenes.json*.

If you'd like to rough it though, go ahead and checkout 'scenes.json' and fiddle. I don't care.

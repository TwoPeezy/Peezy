Guy Peezy, private eye. Once upon a time, I was a cop. I didn't abide by the rules, I got cases closed on my own terms. Broken bones, a mild case of major blood loss. The police commissioner thought I was casting a bad shadow on the team, so he got rid of me. I've been solving easy cases ever since then. Missing pets weren't really my style, but I kept working, waiting for that one case that would put me into the limelight again. That was when Crystal showed up, and my career changed forever.

This file is the main functionality behind this game.
In order to add a Scene, it requires 4 parameters.
    1. Name of the scene (Goes on title of window)
    2. A picture resource URI
    3. Description for the scene
    4. Array of "MenuOption"s

==~
=-  new Scene(name, picture, description, array(MenuOptions))
==~

So to setup a scene JSON object in the scenes.json file:
===

, // <-----  DON'T FORGET COMMAS here if you're appending. The scenes.json in itself is a dictionary.
"scene number": {
        
        "id": idNumber, // same as scene number
        
        "name": "Human Readable Title", // Also goes to the right or the window title
        
        "image": "assets/img/Crystal.jpg", //URL to an image file
        
        "description": " Description that goes to the right or below image ",
        "options": [{
            "text": " text that goes on the button ",
            "scene": " link to another scene (just the id number) ",
            "id": 0 // manually entering the array indexes of the buttons (confusing, but need it for JQuery). Increment by 1.
        }, {
            "text": " another button text ",
            "scene": " another link to a scene ",
            "id": 1 // keep incrementing by 1
        }]
    } // No comma here if you're at the end of the file
